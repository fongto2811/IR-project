The round, 4mm soft lead core allows for a quick laydown of smooth colour, producing a vibrant finish for bold and expressive drawings. The water soluble pigments can be used for expressive drawings, or mixed with water to create a bright, yet translucent ink-like effect. As the pigment dries quickly, there\u2019s no need to worry about colour bleeding. Perfect for colour layering. Plus, as the colours dry permanently, they are great on fabrics, such as silk or cotton. They can also easily be used on paper. Modify the use to fit your next project. You can create custom shades by mixing colours together, or obtain lighter shades of the same colour by adding water. Mix colours to create a truly unique piece of art. With a heritage dating to 1832, Derwent\u2019s innovation comes from an understanding of artists. We\u2019ve produced a range of quality art materials, many of which are made in our British manufacturing plant.", "price": {"value": "20.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Derwent-Colored-Pencils-Inktense-Drawing/dp/B000PD3M84/ref=sr_1_1331?qid=1684769155&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-1331"}
