It is permanent on porous surfaces and erasable on most non-porous surfaces. Ideal for beginners and professionals alike, these versatile markers are perfect for arts and crafts, coloring, line drawing, and ornamentation. The marker tips can be rinsed with water to keep them intact, allowing you to dilute, mix, and blend without fear of ruining your marker.", "price": {"value": "17.79", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Posca-Acrylic-Reversible-Painting-Graffiti/dp/B000IGU27W/ref=sr_1_55?qid=1684768588&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-55"}
