The sturdy polyolefin is reinforced with steel wire for an ultra-tough hose. It is also collapsible, so you only have to extend as much hose as you need. This kit features a bayonet fitting with four prongs for a more fastened fit. At the dump-station end, we've added a transparent elbow with an easily detachable 4-in-1 adapter for connecting to 3-inch slip or 3-inch, 3 1/2-inch and 4-inch NPT threaded sewer connection. The kit also includes a storage cap for each end. The hose and fittings compress to 56-inches for storage and once the 4-in-1 adapter is removed, you can store the hose in standard 4-inch square bumpers.", "price": {"value": "36.97", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Camco-RhinoFLEX-Translucent-Frustration-Free-39770/dp/B01HPHR2M4/ref=sr_1_30?qid=1684811431&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-30"}
