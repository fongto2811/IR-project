Its one piece construction is specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adheres to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Soothie is designed to calm and soothe without inhibiting normal oral development, like the natural development of teeth and gums. Transparent, tasteless and odorless, the nipple is strong and smooth. It won't become sticky, discolored or misshapen. Soothie is made of hospital-grade, BPA-free and latex-free silicone for strength, comfort and durability. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized in a sterilizer. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us.", "price": {"value": "8.94", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Philips-AVENT-Pacifier-SCF190-41/dp/B07TDN9MKC/ref=sr_1_35?qid=1684817442&s=baby-products-intl-ship&sr=1-35"}
