The fine tip on the other end is for smooth straight lines or writing. The resilient nylon brush retains its point, stroke after stroke. The ink is water-based and blendable: use 2 colors together, or use the colorless blender pen. The pen tips self-clean after blending so there is no messy clean-up! Use these pens for coloring, rubber stamping, hand-lettering, doodling, journaling, and more. Perfect for fine art techniques. The ink is acid-free, non-toxic, odorless, and non-bleeding. Each package contains 10 pens (9 colored, 1 colorless). Available in a variety of color schemes, each sold separately. Conforms to ASTM D 4236.", "price": {"value": "16.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tombow-Markers-Grayscale-10-Pack-Blendable/dp/B0044JOS6K/ref=sr_1_875?qid=1684768946&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-875"}
