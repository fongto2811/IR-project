Secure cuffs and stretchy sides keep leaks locked in where they happen the most. Forget about cheap, leaky diapers and spend more time enjoying this ride known as parenting. With Luvs you know when they go, thanks to a wetness indicator that turns blue on contact with wetness.

When it comes to the ultimate diaper protection, these paws uphold the laws. Our diapers are so good, you don\u2019t need this, but Luvs does offer a money-back guarantee.
