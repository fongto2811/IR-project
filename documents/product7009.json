Samsung 980 PRO PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD for next-level computing delivers twice the data transfer rate of PCIe 3.0, while maintaining compatibility with PCIe 3.0. Experience SSD performance with read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s\u00b2 and push the limits of what SDs can do. Powered by a new in-house controller that is designed to harmonize the flash memory components and the interface for superior speed, with a PCIe 4.0 interface that\u2019s twice as fast as PCIe 3.0 SSDs and 12X faster than Samsung SATA SSDs5, every component of this NVMe SSD is manufactured by Samsung for performance that lasts. High performance SSDs usually require high performance thermal control. That\u2019s why to ensure stable performance, the 980 PRO uses nickel coating to help manage the controller's heat level and a heat spreader label to deliver effective thermal control of the NAND chip. Designed for hardcore gamers and tech-savvy users, the 980 PRO memory card offers high-performance bandwidth throughput for heavy-duty applications in gaming, graphics, data analytics, and more. It's fast at loading games, so you can play more and wait less. The Samsung 980 PRO also comes in a compact M.2 2280 form, which can be easily plugged into desktop PCs and laptop computers, and due to its size and optimized power efficiency, it\u2019s ideal for building high-performance computing systems.
