And aside from the belly, thighs, hips, breasts, and buttocks can all show signs of stretching. The cause? The collagen and elastin fibers that keep your skin firm and tight stretch and tear due to the pregnancy hormones and the pressure on your body from the rapid weight gain. While you can\u2019t prevent stretch marks, you can help reduce their appearance with the support from Palmer's. Whatever product you choose - whether it's a stretch mark cream, a stretch mark oil, or a stretch mark lotion, natural cocoa butter is safe to use on your body while pregnant and helps reduce stretch marks as you and your baby grow. Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Lotion helps visibly improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of stretch marks. Pure Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Natural Oils, Collagen, Elastin, and Lutein keep skin moisturized and supple for 48 hours. A pregnancy must have, this everyday body lotion is widely recommended for stretch marks during and after pregnancy. This non-greasy lotion is ideal for all over body use, in place of your regular skin moisturizer.
