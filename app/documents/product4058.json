It's the doctor-invented nasal aspirator what actually works! To Use: Place large tube against child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction.", "price": {"value": "21.27", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fridababy-NoseFrida-Aspirator-Hygiene-Filters/dp/B00RP0GHBO/ref=sr_1_49?qid=1684817455&s=baby-products-intl-ship&sr=1-49"}
