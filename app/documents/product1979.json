Fits between tandem tires, it locks wheels by applying force to both tires. Aids in trailer stabilizing and prevents tire shifts. A hand operated plated ratchet wrench (Model 841025, included) turns a drive nut, extending the chocks against the tires for locking and retracting the chucks for removal.", "price": {"value": "74.28", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/X-Chock-Wheel-Stabilizer-Handle-28012/dp/B002XLHUQG/ref=sr_1_180?qid=1684811495&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-180"}
