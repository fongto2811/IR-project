The Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat grows with your child from rear-facing harness (4-50 lbs) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lbs). It features a 4-position extension panel that provides up to 5\u201d of extra rear-facing legroom, allowing your child to safely ride rear-facing longer. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. With Extend2Fit, the adjustable extension panel and 50 lbs rear-facing weight limit allow the seat to grow with your child in rear-facing mode, providing extended rear-facing use. The seat features the No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust Harness System, which allows you to adjust the height of the headrest and harness in one motion, and InRight LATCH for a one-second LATCH attachment. Harnessing is made easier with fuss-free harness storage pockets that conveniently hold the harness out of the way while you get baby in and out of the car seat. This car seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes.", "price": {"value": "199.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Graco-Extend2Fit-Convertible-Seat-Gotham/dp/B019EGMGR0/ref=sr_1_125?qid=1684817487&s=baby-products-intl-ship&sr=1-125"}
