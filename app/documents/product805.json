Die cutting is a quick and easy way of producing individual, or mass shapes from paper, foil, cardstock or even chipboard using a machine and die, instead of cutting by hand. What cuts my material? A die cutting machine will always be necessary in order to die cut, though it's not the machine itself that physically cuts your material. The die cutter you use (for example a Sizzix Bigz, Thinlits or Framelits die), is responsible for revealing your design. The machine just applies the pressure. So if you're ever unsure whether you can die cut a certain material, check the compatibility of your die rather than your machine.", "price": {"value": "92.98", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Sizzix-660200-Cutting-Embossing-Machine/dp/B00R50G1I8/ref=sr_1_793?qid=1684768913&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-793"}
