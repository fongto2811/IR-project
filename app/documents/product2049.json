The integrated Thin Shade keeps the sun\u2019s rays out of your RV living space, helping to regulate the interior temperature. The Thin Shade also provides instant privacy when needed. With its easy retract and extend operation, the Thin Shade offers instant privacy by simply pulling down on the shade handle. Other sun-blocking products on the market require snaps or Velcro to hold them in place - this is not only unattractive but requires them to be stored when not in use. The Thin Shade\u2019s simple, integrated design is not only sleek but will never have to be stored when not in use.", "price": {"value": "50.34", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lippert-Components-786037-Black-Prepped/dp/B07XPGBPFQ/ref=sr_1_250?qid=1684811526&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-250"}
