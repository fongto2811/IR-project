ZipWall Self-Adhesive Zippers allow you to quickly create a doorway in plastic dust barriers, providing easy entry and exit. Remove the paper backing and stick the zipper to the plastic barrier. Then, open the zipper and cut the plastic to make a door. All ZipWall heavy-duty zippers come with flap hooks and one ZipperKnife sheeting cutter. The ZipWall Dust Barrier System can be set up by one person in minutes without tape, ladders or damage. Our complete system includes spring-loaded poles to set up a barrier up to 20 feet high and accessories to create entries in the barrier, form tight seals at the ceiling, walls, and floor, easily seal off doors and doorways, and provide comprehensive solutions for containing airborne dust. It is ideal for residential and commercial use during remodeling, renovation and restoration.", "price": {"value": "22.08", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/ZipWall-2-Pack-Heavy-Duty-Barriers-HDAZ2/dp/B0022NHLEQ/ref=sr_1_722?qid=1684768881&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-722"}
