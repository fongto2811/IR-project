This brush is made from soft thick haired 100 percent sheepskin. The Gerbil Wheel Brush is all-wheel friendly making it safe to use on all surfaces while being the most absorbent brush in its class. It is the perfect tool to use on all wheel finishes including alloy, chrome, anodized and polished wheels. The specially treated sheepskin construction holds over 8 ounces of soapy water or degreaser - excellent for keeping the surface well lubricated. When it comes to getting into tight spaces, there is nothing like the right lubrication to reduce friction and improve results. Its small cone shaped head reaches deep into tight holes and cracks for superior cleaning with a gentle touch. Lastly, rinse wheel for a perfect scratch free finish. The ergonomic design of the gerbil makes it easy to use and fit anywhere, while the easy-grip design minimizes wrist effort and motion. The durable sheepskin finish is pre-treated for long lasting durability while the multi-pore memory foam sponge core is engineered to retain soap and degreasers which eliminates bacterial and residue left inside.", "price": {"value": "10.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-Acc_B01-Gerbil-Wheel/dp/B00BJCHX8K/ref=sr_1_84?qid=1684811453&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-84"}
