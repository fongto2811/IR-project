The towel is wrapped in a silky soft satin sewn edge which extends the life of the towel. The silk sewn edges act like a safeguard against light swirls and scratches. Inferior towels without the silk edges have a polyester edge that can easily scratch paint. This towel is designed to deliver maximum absorbency, a single towel can hold 8 9 times its weight in water. This waffle weave towel is 100 percent machine washable. This towel is easy to wash using your favorite detergent. Toss it right into the washing machine for easy care. Just be sure to wash them separately, to keep them lint free. As with all microfiber products, never expose them to fabric softener. Fabric softener will reduce their static properties and cause the microfiber to clean/spread less effectively. They can be line dried or machine dried on low setting, again, separately from other laundry.", "price": {"value": "10.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-MIC_781_01-Waffle-Microfiber/dp/B00BQYCIVI/ref=sr_1_103?qid=1684811464&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-103"}
