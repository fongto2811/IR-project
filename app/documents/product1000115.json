ATTENTION MAC USERS - Beginning with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Apple has eliminated the option to run 32-bit apps on the Mac. If you wish to continue using our applications, which currently require 32-bit support, do not upgrade your operating system past Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave). Alternatively, you can retain an older Mac operating system on a separate drive partition. eMedia developers are currently working on software updates to support Catalina and future versions of macOS, but this is a major undertaking. eMedia is currently unable to foresee how long it will take to create these new versions. If you purchased your eMedia software on or after September 7, 2019, upon receiving proof of purchase eMedia Music will provide you with a free upgrade to a macOS 10.15 (Catalina)-compatible version of an eMedia application when it becomes available. All other registered owners of eMedia software will be qualified for discounted upgrades.", "price": {"value": "35.48", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/eMedia-Piano-Keyboard-Method-v3/dp/B003NVHWO0/ref=sr_1_116?qid=1685339135&s=software-intl-ship&sr=1-116"}
