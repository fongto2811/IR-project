Every PUCK cartridge comes packed with a punch of lavender-scented baking soda, powered by Arm & Hammer. Whenever you're not using your STEP or PAIL diaper pail, fear not! PUCK works while the pails' lids are closed to ensure everything remains fresh and free of unwanted odors. It's recommended that you replace PUCK every 60-90 days for best results, and it can even be used beyond the pail (e.g. in garbage cans, diaper bags, etc.)!", "price": {"value": "6.29", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Baking-Cartridge-Powered-Lavender/dp/B01BDQDIJ4/ref=sr_1_77?qid=1684817466&s=baby-products-intl-ship&sr=1-77"}
