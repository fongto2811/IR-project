A diaper that doesn't leave skin wet, especially overnight. That's why new Pampers Swaddlers Overnights absorb wetness better and provide up to 100% leak-proof nighttime skin protection to help keep your baby's skin healthy and protected all night long. New Swaddlers Overnights are designed with a Wrap&Protect Waistband that gently wraps around baby to help protect skin from irritation, and Wrap&Protect leg barriers that protect where leaks happen most. A restful night\u2019s sleep starts with the right protection from wetness, which is why Swaddlers Overnights are extra absorbent to keep baby's skin dry throughout the night. Pampers LockAway Channels lock wetness away for dry, healthy skin while the BreatheFree Liner wicks away wetness, allowing baby's skin to breathe. Plus, Pampers Swaddlers Overnights are Skin Health Alliance Dermatologist Approved, hypoallergenic and free of parabens and latex,* so you can trust them to be safe and gentle on your little one\u2019s delicate skin. Pampers Swaddlers Overnights are available in sizes 3\u20136 and come in eight fun nighttime prints.
