Not any more! To create effective teams, we must juggle a lot of variables: We want teams of four, but must form some teams of three or five to handle \"extra\" students. We want two boys and two girls per team, but when we run out of balanced sex teams we want same sex teams so the solo boy or girl are not given too much or too little attention. We want a high, high-medium, low-medium, and low ability student on each team to optimize tutoring and achievement. Creating teams can be a brain-racking, time-consuming process. Now, you simply click a button. TeamTools takes your class info and recommends teams for you. If you like the recommended teams, you save, print, or display them for your class. If you\u2019re not happy with the suggested teams, you push a button to try again, or fine-tune the teams yourself by moving students around. Forming flexible groups for differentiated instruction is also a snap. TeamTools gives you six ways to form teams, six ways to form pairs, and two ways to split the class into two teams. You can use TeamTools for up to 8 different classrooms. Create and manage teams like a pro with TeamTools!", "price": {"value": "29.00", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Kagan-Cooperative-Learning-Software-ETM/dp/B00517KB9W/ref=sr_1_233?qid=1685339180&s=software-intl-ship&sr=1-233"}
