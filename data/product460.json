Simply lift the cap and twist the base for easy application. White glue goes on smoothly, minimizing any clumping or wrinkling, and dries clear. Holds strong with a gentle touch- permanent glue bonds securely to a variety of materials but washes easily off hands and clothing. White glue bonds to paper, photos, cardboard, foam board, fabric, glass and more. Avery Glue Stics are a great acid-free glue to add to any student's school supply list. The larger 1.27 oz. stick covers more surface area and is excellent for projects requiring more adhesive.

Avery Glue Stics are also great during the holidays. Seamlessly put the last finishing touches on your gift wrap or seal the envelope to your custom greeting card with one swipe of your glue stick.
