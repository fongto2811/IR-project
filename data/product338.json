The powerful 5x lens is housed in a robust sliding case that protects it from dust, debris, and scratches. When the protective cover slides up, it activates a powerful LED light, giving you brilliant illumination. It is then automatically turned off when you slide the case closed, ensuring an efficient battery life. The MiniBrite is ultra-compact and portable, weighing less than 2 ounces. It is the ideal size for pockets, purses, junk-drawers, glove boxes, and more. It's the type of magnifier that can easily be at the ready to read small print in newspapers, look at a menu in a dimly lit restaurant, inspect details on stamps and coins, or for any other situation requiring attention to details. High Quality Optics The MiniBrite incorporates a precision molded acrylic aspheric lens. The shape of an aspheric lenses allows light rays converge at a single focal point resulting in a sharper, clearer and distortion-free image. We utilize an acrylic, as it has the advantages of being lightweight, durable, and shatter-resistant, while still maintaining a beautiful image. The MiniBrite uses 3 AAA batteries (not included).", "price": {"value": "9.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Carson-MiniBrite-Lighted-Aspheric-Magnifier/dp/B00524H8MC/ref=sr_1_338?qid=1684768713&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-338"}
