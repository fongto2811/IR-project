The hooks are designed to twist into drywall, and then push the head of the hook until it sits flush with the wall. The rear tip of the hook will engage into the back of the drywall, which gives the hook it\u2019s superior holding strength.\n\nThe patented design of the head creates a groove in between the back of the head and the wall, to make sure whatever you hang on it, stays on it. This small head version is designed to work with all types of hanging hardware (wire, D-rings, sawtooth hooks and keyhole hangers) and is particularly well suited to work with D-rings and keyhole hangers.\n\nNote that these hangers require that the area behind the drywall where they are being installed has room for the wire, so they cannot be installed over top of a wall stud, or in plaster walls.\n\nRemoving the DecoHook is as simple as pulling it out in the reverse way that it was installed, and it only leaves a tiny hole behind. DecoHooks are available in two head sizes (small and large) as well as in two versions to carry either 20 lbs or 40 lbs maximum.", "price": {"value": "10.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Under-Roof-Decorating-5-100148-Project/dp/B074XNCHTX/ref=sr_1_1566?qid=1684769313&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-1566"}
