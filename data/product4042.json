Munchkin's best-selling Snack Catcher to the rescue! This portable snack bowl allows independent toddlers to self-feed with a bit more dexterity and a lot less mess. Kids love accessing snacks all by themselves through the soft, flexible flaps, and moms love that those same flaps help prevent food spills all over the house and car. Each spill proof Snack Catcher cup has two handles designed for even the littlest hands to grasp easily, and a no slip rubber bottom to keep it in place on the dinner table, in the high chair, or during lunchtime at school. Snack Catcher food containers are a must have for toddlers on the move. And because snacks come out only when they want them to, snack time no longer means food everywhere except your child's mouth. Win for all.
