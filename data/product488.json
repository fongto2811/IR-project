It has the highest strength of our epoxies. It is waterproof and more heat resistant. SLOW-CURE can be used for bonding if you\u2019re willing to wait overnight. Fillers such as micro balloons can be mixed with SLOW-CURE and FINISH-CURE to form a putty-like consistency. Such fillers will usually decrease the working time by about 25%. Bonded objects can be handled after 8 hours and the cured epoxy reaches full strength within 24 hours.
