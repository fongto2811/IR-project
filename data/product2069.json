The squeegee is proven to last 2X longer than traditional natural rubber squeegees, based on third-party testing. Designed to endure the toughest conditions, the silicone squeegee maintains excellent stability and performance during long-term exposure to harsh climates and environmental elements. It will not dry out and crack in the summer heat or freeze and break in the winter cold and is resistant to the motor oils, fluids, and solvents encountered on the road that cause organic rubbers to deteriorate rapidly. Rain-X Silicone Endura provides superior wipe quality in the most extreme temperatures (tested to -20\u00b0F and +194\u00b0F) and in all types of severe or inclement weather conditions experienced while driving, such as heat, wind, rain, sleet, snow, and ice.
