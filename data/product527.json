Each TEAR-AID Repair Patch is made from an exceptionally tough, matte finish, abrasion resistant, elastomer that resists puncture and tearing. It is combined with an aggressive adhesive formulated for high bond strength. Tear-Aid expands absorbing force on impact and always returns to original shape and size. This flexibility allows the patch to conform to irregular surfaces without restricting the movement of the repaired material. The TEAR-AID Type B vinyl repair patch sticks to - Vinyl and Vinyl-coated material ONLY. Vinyl has oils that are absorbed by most adhesives which causes the adhesive to turn gooey, gummy, and ultimately lose bond. Tear-Aid vinyl repair patches contain an inhibitor that blocks the oils found in vinyl resulting in a long lasting repair. Each patch kit contains - (1) 3\" x 12\" TEAR-AID Patch that cuts easily with scissors to any size, (1) 7/8 x 7/8\" Patch, (1) 1 3/8 x 1 3/8\" Patch, (1) 12\" Reinforcement Filament for repairing tears at edges, (2) Alcohol Prep Pads, (1) Illustrated Instructions, Kit Dimensions: 3\"x 5.5\"x 1.25\"", "price": {"value": "9.37", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tear-Aid-Vinyl-Seat-Repair-Blue/dp/B005CE33HG/ref=sr_1_525?qid=1684768788&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-525"}
