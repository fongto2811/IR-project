Personalizing gifts, engraving names, and simple tool labeling can now be done at home with the hand held electric engraver. The replaceable tungsten carbide tip provides precise, clean strokes while staying sharp throughout multiple uses and you can easily adjust the depth of the needle with the adjustment knob. The 120-volt power of the engraver delivers over 7200 rpm making it powerful enough to engrave through different surfaces including wood, plastic, metal, and even glass. The soft rubber and lightweight construction gives you a natural pencil like grip so you can easily engrave simple names with two included stencils to even detailed art work applications. Unlike a laser engraver machine this tool uses a bit and hammer like style at a push of a button.", "price": {"value": "30.58", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-Handheld-Electric-Engraver-Templates/dp/B075TXPWCK/ref=sr_1_1449?qid=1684769226&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-1449"}
