You get an extremely natural look - just by shampooing as you normally do. Just use it instead of your usual shampoo until you like what you see. Then use it in rotation with your usual shampoo to maintain the look you like. There's never been an easier way to control your grey. Get the look you want: Use the control GX as your daily shampoo, and after the first few washes, you'll start to see a subtle reduction in the amount of gray. Continue to use it until you reach your desired level of grey reduction (generally within 2 to 4 weeks). You can even control how gradually you get to your desired result by using it daily or every other day at the start. Keep it that way: Once you've reached the level of grey reduction you like, you can reduce the frequency of use, alternating with another shampoo. In general guys use it as their daily shampoo at the start, and when they are in \"maintenance mode\" they use it 3 to 4 times a week.", "price": {"value": "9.97", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Just-Men-Control-Reducing-Shampoo-Gradually/dp/B0829M59K8/ref=sr_1_147?qid=1684824147&s=beauty-intl-ship&sr=1-147"}
