They can hold up to 20 lbs (9 kg) on a single nail, and are designed to be installed in the wall at a 90 degree angle so the plastic head of the nail is flush to the wall.\n\nThe patented design of the head creates a groove in between the back of the head and the wall, to make sure whatever you hang on it, stays on it. This small head version is designed to work with all types of hanging hardware (wire, D-rings, sawtooth hooks and keyhole hangers) and is particularly well suited to work with D-rings and keyhole hangers.\n\nRemoving the DecoNails is simple: using the claw of a hammer, place it behind the tip of the nail and pull it out of the wall just enough to get the claw behind the plastic head, and pull it out the rest of the way. DecoNails are available in two head sizes (small and large) to fit whatever type and size of hardware your wall decor has.", "price": {"value": "5.49", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Under-Roof-Decorating-Small-Sampler/dp/B00N28F4XU/ref=sr_1_1737?qid=1684769418&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-1737"}
