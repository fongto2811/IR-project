Unlike ordinary disposable diapers that gap in the back, Pampers Cruisers 360 diapers stretch comfortably around your baby's waist and adapt to their every move for a flexible, gap-free fit that is up to 100% leakproof. Plus, they feature our Dual Leak-Guard Barriers that gently seal around your baby's legs, where leaks happen most. And forget fiddling with ordinary diaper tapes! Pampers Cruisers 360 has a 360-degree stretchy waistband designed to quickly and easily pull up onto your wiggly baby. And when a diaper change is complete, we\u2019ve made disposal simple. All you need to do is RIP the Easy-Tear Sides and ROLL the diaper, then secure it with the disposal tape that comes attached to the back. Simple as that. Also, to keep your baby's delicate skin healthy, Pampers Cruisers 360 delivers breathable dryness, pulling out wetness and locking it away from skin using our exclusive LockAway Channels. Plus, Cruisers 360 is hypoallergenic\u2014completely free of elemental chlorine bleaching, parabens and latex.* For protection that will keep your little one happy and comfy on-the-go, trust Pampers, the #1 pediatrician recommended brand. *Natural rubber", "price": {"value": "55.94", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pampers-Cruisers-Disposable-Waistband-Packaging/dp/B08PX2V7PG/ref=sr_1_39?qid=1684817442&s=baby-products-intl-ship&sr=1-39"}
