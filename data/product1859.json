These microfiber applicator pads are inside stitched two times to ensure that the edges never touch the surface of your paint which reduces surface scratches and improves the application of the product. These applicator pads are professional grade and gentle, yet are strong and highly absorbent. This premium 100 percent machine washable micro fiber fabric is wrapped around a plush, dura foam sponge. These applicator pads are engineered to deliver just the right amount of product without saturating the sponge or retaining product which leads to waste. These microfiber applicators allow wax, polish, dressings and sealants to be spread more evenly, resulting in maximum coverage while using less emulsion and saving time and money. These pads are 100 percent machine washable but it is recommended that they be washed separately to ensure they remain lint free. As with all microfiber products, they should never be exposed to fabric softener as it will reduce static properties and cause the pad to clean and spread less effectively.", "price": {"value": "6.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-MIC_292_02-Microfiber-Applicator/dp/B00BJCN7Z8/ref=sr_1_60?qid=1684811443&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-60"}
