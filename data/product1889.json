McGard manufactures wheel locks in the USA to meet or exceed OEM standards for safety and durability. Presently, McGard is an Original Equipment wheel lock supplier to over 30 car lines around the world. These easy-to-use, one-piece wheel locks function like regular lug nuts, but require a special key tool for installation and removal. The steel collar on the user friendly key guides the key into the lock pattern. The collar holds the key in alignment for easy installation and removal. The computer generated key designs allow for an infinite number of key patterns. The extra narrow pattern groove on the lock resists the intrusion of removal tools into the pattern. Every McGard wheel lock is fully machined from restricted chemistry steel made specifically for McGard and through-hardened for its unsurpassed level of security. McGard\u2019s plating process includes three layers of nickel and one layer of microporous chrome producing a superior finish while protecting against rust.
