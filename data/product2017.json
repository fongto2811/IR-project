Whatever type of load you are hauling, having towing equipment that can work as hard as you do is a must. For all types of heavy-duty towing, CURT 5/8\" hitch pins and clips pack a little extra punch. We make our 5/8\" hitch pins out of solid steel and coat them in one of four finish options. All of these finishes offer excellent resistance to rust and corrosion for long-lasting, smooth operation. CURT hitch pins are also constructed with a 105-degree bend, creating a useful handle for a better grip and allowing the pin to stay securely engaged in the trailer hitch and ball mount. This particular 5/8\" hitch pin features a black zinc finish and comes with a standard retainer hole to accept the included clip. It provides reliable installation for any ball mount or hitch-mounted accessory with a 2\" shank, making it the perfect fit for class 3, 4 and 5 trailer hitches.", "price": {"value": "3.23", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/CURT-21578-Trailer-Diameter-Receiver/dp/B001GN1GLM/ref=sr_1_218?qid=1684811516&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-218"}
