And with baby skin being 30 percent thinner than ours, the best care is the gentlest. To help protect your little one\u2019s skin, we created Baby Dove Fragrance Free Moisture Hypoallergenic Baby Wash to provide ultra-gentle care for baby's sensitive skin. Unlike other baby washes, our tear-free and hypoallergenic baby wash and shampoo is made with 100 percent skin-natural nutrients, which are identical to those naturally found in skin, and prebiotic moisture to help replenish the essential moisture and nutrients that baby\u2019s skin can lose during bath time. This fragrance free baby bath wash is safety-tested and pediatrician recommended. And our caring formula is gentle enough to use on newborns and free of dyes, parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. To use this baby wash, gently wet baby\u2019s hair and skin with warm water, work into a lather, and rinse for touchably soft skin. We know there\u2019s no right or wrong way to be a parent \u2013 only your way. That\u2019s why Baby Dove is here to help give you confidence that you\u2019re providing the best skin care for your baby's skin. Our Fragrance Free Moisture Hypoallergenic Baby Wash is sold in 13 oz. and 20 oz. bottles. Looking for something for a calming bedtime routine?
