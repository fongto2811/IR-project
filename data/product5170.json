This soft, weightless facial sunscreen with vitamin E defends your skin by providing all-day hydration, plus broad-spectrum UVA and UVB protection. The sheer sunscreen serum from a dermatologist-recommended brand leaves skin feeling soft and smooth--and serves double duty as a makeup primer. It's water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, and the fragrance-free formula is both oxybenzone-free and non-comedogenic. In addition to preventing sunburn, when used with other sun-protection methods, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face Serum sunscreen decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun. Apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure, and reapply after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating, immediately after towel-drying, and at least every two hours. For children under 6 months of age, ask their doctor about sunscreen use.", "price": {"value": "14.12", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Moisturizing-Protection-Fragrance-Free-Oxybenzone-Free/dp/B09MV3MHJD/ref=sr_1_171?qid=1684824157&s=beauty-intl-ship&sr=1-171"}
