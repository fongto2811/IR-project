It removes air from the break, fills it with durable resin and makes it even stronger than before. For best results, repairs should be made as soon as possible after the damage occurs and before the break is contaminated by dirt or water. In addition, avoid the use of glass treatments after the crack has formed and prior to repair. However, glass treatments can be applied one (1) week after repair. The kit works best on round damage not more than one inch in diameter, and cracks not longer than 12 inches. It will not repair damage to more than one layer of glass.", "price": {"value": "12.46", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Rain-X-600001-Windshield-Repair-Kit/dp/B00IPS4APU/ref=sr_1_8?qid=1684811422&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-8"}
