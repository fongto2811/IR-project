The ball handle awl establishes a starting point which reduces the chances of tools wandering. If you don't create a starting point for your instruments, they can wander across the surface of the wood, causing major damage. To scribe lines on your project, first, use a pencil to mark the location of where you're going to create the hole. Place a straightedge across the marks to create a groove and use your hand saw or chisel to cut. To make your holes, simply mark the location and push the puncher into the wood. Next, you'll want to position the bit into the hole and drill. The woodworking awl has an overall length of 6.5\" with a 3.5\" blade, making it easy to create a sharp point for jobs that require heavy marking. We're proud to provide merchants, artisans, and DIYers worldwide with a broad range of affordable, specific-purpose mechanical hand tools and precision measuring and inspection gear.", "price": {"value": "6.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-818-Hardwood-Scratch/dp/B00004T7R3/ref=sr_1_172?qid=1684768639&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-172"}
