Featuring your favorite heroes Catboy, Owlette and Gekko, these super soft and comfy training pants fit just like real cotton undies with a 360 stretchy waistband that is gentle on your child\u2019s skin and easy to pull up and down. Plus, they\u2019re dermatologically tested, hypoallergenic, and free of parabens and latex.* That\u2019s just one of the many reasons Pampers is the #1 pediatrician recommended brand. When it comes to potty accidents, your toddler will be covered with up to 100% leakproof protection. To protect where leaks happen most, Easy Ups are made with Dual Leak-Guard Barriers around the leg cuffs while Extra Absorb Channels quickly absorb accidents and lock them away from your toddler's skin. And when it's time to take them off, Easy-Tear Sides make removal and disposal a cinch. Potty-training is a journey and can take your toddler 90 days on average to catch on. So, Pampers Easy Ups makes it easy with each box containing a one-month supply of training pants.
