Formulated with beeswax and Japan wax, Bed Head's Hair Wax Stick creates instant texture and control and is also great for sleek buns and ponytails. With a hold level of 4/5, this hair styling product adds pliable hold with a semi-matte finish, giving you the control you need to keep your hair in check all day long. It\u2019s perfect for all hair lengths and easy to work in and wash out, so you can create your favorite style with no mess. Our defining paste uses castor oil to condition hair, leaving it smooth and frizz free while leaving a fresh and aromatic fragrance with notes of lavender, coriander, warm cedar and white musk. How to use: For short hairstyles, apply directly to the hair in circles for a fun, ruffled texture. For ponytails, use it to push down flyaways and seal the hair down for a sleek wet look with great shine. To tackle flyaways, apply onto your fingers and push through the hair. For a separated, fun look, use your fingers to piece it through updos or braids. If needed, use a hairdryer to gently heat up the wax before applying for a smoother application.", "price": {"value": "14.29", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/TIGI-Pliable-Styling-Product-Beeswax/dp/B000141L58/ref=sr_1_121?qid=1684824135&s=beauty-intl-ship&sr=1-121"}
