The larger the number on the dial it's set, the longer lead core it's sharpened. Shorter pencil tip is sturdier with less lead breakage and perfect for softer lead such as color pencils or for short pencils such as golf pencils and half pencils. Longer lead point lasts longer before having to sharpen again and is suitable for harder lead pencils. With any angle the dial is set, this angle adjustable manual pencil sharpener produces a perfect sharp point every time. When not in use, set the dial to \"close\" so the shutter slides down and keeps the pencil shavings from falling out of the hole. Contoured body fits comfortably in your hand and a little bulky receptacle can keep more shavings before it needs dumping. Clear. Made in Japan.", "price": {"value": "7.84", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Kutsuwa-Adjustable-Sharpener-Transparent-RS028CL/dp/B07DFH4ZKC/ref=sr_1_1692?qid=1684769390&s=arts-crafts-intl-ship&sr=1-1692"}
