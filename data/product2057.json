Who cares?! Slime\u2019s new 2-in-1 Tire & Tube Premium Sealant works in all off-highway tires and tubes! Now, get all the benefits of Slime with less confusion on which sealant to use. It just works! Slime's 2-in-1 Tire & Tube Premium Sealant seeks out and instantly seals tread area punctures up to a 1/4\u201d in tires and up to 1/8\u201d in tubes. When a puncture occurs, Slime\u2019s patented sealant is carried directly to the source. The pressure of the escaping air forces the particles into the opening, where they build up and intertwine to form a long-lasting, flexible plug. Instantly, air loss is blocked and a flat tire is prevented. Install in any of your tube or tubeless non-highway vehicles (including ATVs/UTVs, golf carts, riding lawn mowers, small trailers, tractors, scooters, bicycles, dirt bikes and much more) and enjoy two years of continuous flat tire protection. No more flats!", "price": {"value": "15.99", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Slime-10194-Off-Highway-Non-Toxic-Eco-Friendly/dp/B08TFGLRL1/ref=sr_1_268?qid=1684811537&s=automotive-intl-ship&sr=1-268"}
