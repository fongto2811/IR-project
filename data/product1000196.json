SmartScore X2 Pro recognizes scores without any restriction on the number of parts. Process band arrangements, operas, hymns, musicals, instrumental and solo parts as well as full conductor's scores. A selection of Garritan band and orchestral instrument sounds is included free so your music will sound rich, nuanced and true-to-life. SmartScore X2 is an indispensable tool for any arranger, performer, music educator or church minister. Recognition accuracy is the heart of any music-scanning program and Musitek's new Prodigy Engine is at the heart of SmartScore X2 (Version 10.5). Musical scores, whether scanned or downloaded as PDF files, are read and interpreted more accurately, more completely and more quickly than any other music scanning software. Accuracy is one thing. Use-ability is another. SmartScore X2 offers an even larger set of useful tools and features than ever before while maintaining its easy-to-use profile. We've worked hard over these past few years to make this the most exciting and most useful SmartScore upgrade ever.", "price": {"value": "365.84", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/SmartScore-X2-Pro-sheet-music/dp/B00BEGW9QC/ref=sr_1_197?qid=1685339167&s=software-intl-ship&sr=1-197"}
