Today they are formulated from a series of soluble dyes in a superior shellac solution. These inks can be applied with brush, dip pen or airbrush and are widely used by designers, calligraphers and artists as well as illustrators. All colors in the Winsor & Newton line of Drawing Inks are fully intermixable and they are easily diluted (with distilled water).
