Each razor blade refill is engineered to last up to 15 comfortable shaves, so you can get the most of every shave. The Gillette Mach3 razors for men have stronger-than-steel blades stay sharper longer (vs. Sensor3). Along with durability, these Gillette razors feature a lubrication strip that glides to help protect your skin from redness, while soft microfins gently stretch and smooth skin, preparing hairs to be cut for the optimal shaving experience. A Lubrastrip is a thin strip that sits at the top of the razor, releasing lubricants while you shave, to produce a great glide. When you are no longer getting an optimal shave, the Lubrastrip fades to white, indicating that it might be time to change the blade. Mach3 features three DuraComfort blades and an Open Blade Architecture for easy rinsing to keep your razor clean and performing its best. Not sure if these blades will fit your existing handle? All Gillette Mach3 razor blades fit all Mach3 razor handles. For best results, use with your favorite Gillette shave gel, cream or foam.", "price": {"value": "32.10", "currency": "$"}, "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Mach3-Razor-Blades-Refills/dp/B0725BK81G/ref=sr_1_128?qid=1684824135&s=beauty-intl-ship&sr=1-128"}
